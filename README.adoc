= Microservices Project: Level 1

This project is intended to be the first (of many) steps in creating a microservices project. In this repository, we use the following technologies:

* Spring Boot
* Java
* REST services
* Lombok

== Architecture

image::microservices-level1.png[]

We have 2 services in this repository: `service1` and `service2`. Responsibilities of each service are outlined below.

* Service1: backend service for hosting the REST api endpoint (`localhost:8081/text`)
* Service2: client REST service for calling the available REST endpoint in service1 and returning the result (`Hello, World!`)

With both services running, we can use service2 to execute whatever service(s) created on the backend (service1).

== Microservices functions

There are a variety of reasons businesses and users might choose to develop applications in a microservices architecture. Some potential reasons are listed below.

* Scalability
* Functionality independence (separating grouped features, often for reliability)
* Maintenance simplicity (changes only affect pieces, and less likely to impact whole)
* Shift resource load (from large instance running single monolith application, to many smaller instances hosting/coordinating microservices)

== Executing the services

To reproduce this intro example, please follow the steps.

1. Clone this repository
2. Run each service (either from an IDE or command line)
3. Test backing service: Open a command line window and execute `curl localhost:8081/text`.
4. Test client service: Open a command line window and execute `curl localhost:8080/hello`.
5. See the results `Hello, World!` appear :)
